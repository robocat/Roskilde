They named their band name after this annus horribilis.   The Norwegians play some of the most intense black metal you will ever experience. Often fear-inducingly fast and packed with slaughtering riffs, at times atmospherically lingering and glancing towards the dormant forests.   1349 is created in the ashes of legendary Alvheim, and Satyricon's Frost whips the drums until you might expect blood to spurt out from them.   The most supreme forces from black Norway perform in full corpse paint and with darkness on the agenda.

Swans are responsible for some of New York's, perhaps the Western world's, most nihilistic music.   As part of the 80s' no wave scene, Swans experimented with noise and drone sounds for the inspiration of a whole generation of bands. On later albums Michael Gira's baritone vocals haunt a burned soundscape where black post-punk and a pronounced sense of tragic beauty form a melodic synthesis.   Now Swans have landed again – ready to explore the seemingly infinite shades of darkness existing in Michael Gira's sewer-black soul.
